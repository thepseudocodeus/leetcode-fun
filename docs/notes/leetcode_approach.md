IQM LeetCode Strategy: A Step-by-Step Guide

1. Define the objects to be transformed.
What are the elements in this space which we are working with?


2. Define the Transformations ("The Actions")

What to do: Break the problem down into its smallest logical parts.

How to do it: For each distinct operation, write a small, pure function.

Its name should clearly describe the single thing it does (e.g., is_odd, square, get_street_name).

It should take input and return output without side effects.

These are your fundamental building blocks. They are easy to reason about and test in isolation.

3. Identify and Isolate Early Exit Conditions ("The Guards")

When should we stop? When does the current state violate expectations?

What to do: Before any processing, ask: "What conditions would make me return immediately?"

How to do it: Write small, pure predicate functions (functions that return True/False) for these conditions.

Examples: list_is_empty(lst), string_is_too_short(s), target_is_impossible(nums, target).

These are your "guards" or "circuit breakers." They protect your main pipeline from invalid or trivial inputs.

4. Compose the Main Pipeline ("The Blueprint")

What are the sequence of transformations to perform in order?

What to do: Describe the sequence of transformations needed to solve the core problem for valid, non-trivial input.

How to do it: Use functional composition to chain your Lego bricks together.

This can be done with HOFs like compose or pipe, or by using tools like map and filter inside a master function.

The pipeline is a declaration of the solution's logic: "To solve this, first do A, then do B, then do C."

5. Assemble the Final Solution ("The Factory")

What should we supply to our execution higher order function?

What to do: Integrate the guards and the pipeline into the final answer.

How to do it: The structure of your solution function becomes a clear, readable decision tree:

Check Guards: If any guard condition is met, return the trivial result immediately.

Run Pipeline: If all guards are passed, feed the input into your pre-composed pipeline and return its result.
