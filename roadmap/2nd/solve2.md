# 2ND SET

## Fundamentals of data structure and algorithms

Goal: Deepen your understanding of core concepts and introduce more complex data structures. This stage transitions from simple problem-solving to recognizing and applying classic algorithmic patterns. You should be comfortable with both iterative and recursive solutions, especially for tree and graph problems. This is where you start to develop a sense for problem patterns.
