# 4th Set

## Fundamentals of Complex Computational Problems

Goal: Tackle complex, multi-faceted problems that require combining multiple algorithms and data structures. This is where you begin to develop "systems thinking" for problem-solving. Problems at this stage are often variations of classic hard problems, requiring a deeper understanding of the trade-offs between different approaches and the ability to find an optimal solution.

Goal: This is the pinnacle of the competitive programming curriculum. The problems here are designed to challenge your creativity, mathematical intuition, and ability to optimize solutions under tight constraints. They often involve advanced topics not typically found in interviews. The expectation is not just to solve them, but to solve them optimally, with a clear understanding of the complexity and proof of correctness.
