# 3RD SET

## Fundamentals of Competitive Programming

Goal: Move beyond standard interview problems into topics more common in competitive programming. This includes number theory, combinatorics, and efficient string algorithms. You will learn to think computationally about mathematical concepts and apply them to problem-solving. Expect to use bit manipulation, matrix exponentiation, and advanced greedy approaches.
