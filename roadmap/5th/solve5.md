# 5TH SET

## Fundamentals of Mathematical Creativity

Goal: This is the pinnacle of the competitive programming curriculum. The problems here are designed to challenge your creativity, mathematical intuition, and ability to optimize solutions under tight constraints. They often involve advanced topics not typically found in interviews. The expectation is not just to solve them, but to solve them optimally, with a clear understanding of the complexity and proof of correctness.

Maximum Flow Problems (e.g., "Maximum Bipartite Matching")

Distinct Subsequences II (DP with state compression)

Smallest String Starting From Leaf (DFS with advanced pruning)

Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips

Count of Numbers with Unique Digits II (Digit DP)

Sum of Distances in Tree (Tree DP)

Sliding Puzzle (A* Search)

Finding the Path to the Tree's Root in a Graph (Advanced Graph Theory)

Finding the Maximum Weighted Independent Set on a Tree (Tree DP)
