## Fundamentals of Problem Solving

Goal: Master the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures. At this stage, the focus is on building a solid foundation of computational thinking and becoming fluent with basic tools. You should be able to recognize when to use a simple data structure like a hash map or when a two-pointer approach will be more efficient. The problems here are a mix of easy and medium difficulty.
