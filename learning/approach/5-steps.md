This approach can be summarized as:

1. Define the Contract (The Façade): You start by establishing the most fundamental contract: your facade_function. This function is the public-facing API for your solution. It declares, "I will take an input object of a specific state and return an output object of a specific, guaranteed state." This makes your solution's behavior predictable and pure from the outside. .

2. Declare the Output Pipe: You work backward from the facade's output contract. You ask, "What is the simplest function that can take the result from the inner part of the system and format it to meet the facade's contract?" You're not worrying about the problem's logic yet; you're just declaring the final formatting step.

3. Decompose and Transform (Working Backward): You continue this process, creating a pipeline of pure, single-purpose functions. Each function in this pipeline takes the output of the next and transforms it into the input required by the previous. This is a declarative pipe where each component has a simple, well-defined job.

4. Declare the Input Pipe: You then switch to the input side and work forward. You create a pipeline of functions that take the raw problem input and transform it into the simple, clean data that your core logic requires.

5. Connect the Pipes (The Core Logic): By the time you've defined both the input and output pipelines, the core of the problem—the central input -> process -> output transformation—becomes much clearer. The complexity has been managed by the surrounding functions, leaving the core logic to be as simple as possible.

This method forces you to think about the problem in terms of declarative transformations and invariants, ensuring that every component of your solution is a pure function with a clear contract. It's a method that leads to clean, robust, and mathematically sound solutions.
