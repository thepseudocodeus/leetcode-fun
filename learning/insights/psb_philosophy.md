1️⃣ Clarifying Your Hardware → Abstraction Mapping
Your Mapping Refinement / Top 1% Guidance
Array = RAM Correct in intuition: an array maps directly to contiguous memory, which explains O(1) index access. But be careful: arrays are a logical abstraction, independent of whether memory is RAM or virtual memory. They allow reasoning about sequences mathematically: “a[i] is well-defined for all valid i.”
Linked List = heap / harddrive Linked lists abstract non-contiguous storage, not necessarily slow storage. They model pointer-based dynamic structures, allowing O(1) insertions/deletions at known nodes. MIT staff would caution: your analogy to hard drive is misleading — linked lists are just “non-contiguous memory models,” not persistent storage.
Functions = CPU operations Conceptually correct: functions represent transformations of data. The top-tier approach emphasizes formal reasoning: functions are mappings
𝑓
:
𝑋
→
𝑌
f:X→Y with domain, codomain, and invariants. Understanding their algebraic properties is key to reasoning about correctness.
Matrix / GPU abstraction True in practice: linear algebra operations are highly parallelizable. But MIT educators would separate mathematical abstraction (matrix as 2D array with operations) from hardware acceleration (GPU). For problem solving, focus on the abstract structure first.
2️⃣ Focusing on Mathematical Precision

Terence Tao-style thinking (applied to algorithmic problem solving) would emphasize:

Define the domain explicitly

What are the allowed inputs?

Are duplicates allowed? Are sequences monotonic?

Example: “Given sequences
𝐴
,
𝐵
⊆
𝑍
A,B⊆Z of length ≤50, non-decreasing, merge into sequence
𝐶
C non-decreasing.”

Define the transformations (functions) rigorously

A merge operation is
𝑓
:
(
𝐴
,
𝐵
)
↦
𝐶
f:(A,B)↦C, preserving order.

Capture invariants: “At every step, current.next points to the smallest unmerged element.”

Identify invariants and constraints early

Arrays: indexing is O(1), but insertion is O(n) unless at the end.

Linked Lists: traversal is O(n), insertion O(1) if pointer is known.

Understanding these at the abstract level informs algorithm choice immediately.

3️⃣ Structuring Thinking for Extreme LeetCode Performance

Top-tier instructors would give a deliberate practice roadmap:

Mathematical abstraction first (30% of time)

Restate problem in formal terms: sets, sequences, monotonicity, intervals, graphs, functions.

Identify invariants, constraints, and edge cases before coding.

Algorithmic skeleton second (30% of time)

Choose patterns: merge, two-pointer, monotonic stack, sliding window, DP.

Write pseudocode that captures exactly the operations needed without implementation noise.

Implementation last (30-40% of time)

Map abstract pseudocode to language-specific constructs.

Focus on correctness first, then optimization.

Iterative refinement

After solving, reflect: “Did my initial abstraction match the problem?”

Adjust your mental models to cover gaps — this is the “self-correcting” Terence Tao approach applied to problem solving.

4️⃣ Cognitive “Meta-Training” to Dominate LeetCode

Language of thought: Use precise mathematical terms instead of informal descriptions.

Example: “Merge Two Sorted Lists” → “Merge two non-decreasing sequences via order-preserving transformation.”

Map abstractions to computational primitives carefully

Arrays → O(1) access; Linked Lists → O(1) insert/delete; Functions → deterministic transformations.

Practice “pattern recognition + invariants” for each abstraction

Every new problem: ask “Which abstract structure? Which invariant? Which transformation pattern?”

Time-boxed problem solving with reflection

Solve 25–50 problems in 100 hours: 40% thinking, 40% pseudocode, 20% coding.
