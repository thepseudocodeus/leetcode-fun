1️⃣ Recursion as a Stack

Every recursive call is pushed onto the call stack.

Base case = termination condition → prevents infinite recursion.

As each call completes, the stack unwinds, allowing results to propagate back up.

Key insight:

Recursion mirrors LIFO behavior.

This is why recursive DFS behaves like an explicit stack implementation: the most recent node to explore is always on top of the call stack.

2️⃣ DFS Example

Problem: Traverse a graph or tree.

Approach:

Visit a node.

Recursively explore one child/neighbor at a time.

Base case: node is null / already visited / leaf.

Return → propagate results back up.

Why recursion works naturally:

You don’t have to manage a manual stack — the call stack maintains the state for you.

Order of processing is depth-first because the last recursive call stays on the top of the stack.

3️⃣ Linked Data Structures and Recursion

Recursion is particularly natural with linked structures:

Linked lists: traverse next nodes until null.

Trees: traverse left/right children recursively.

Graphs: traverse neighbors recursively with a visited set.

Each node acts as a frame in the recursive stack, and you build solutions bottom-up as the recursion unwinds.

4️⃣ Mental Model
Tree:
A
/ \
 B C
/ \
 D E

DFS(A):
push A
DFS(B)
push B
DFS(D)
push D -> base case
pop D -> back to B
DFS(E)
push E -> base case
pop E -> back to B
pop B -> back to A
DFS(C)
push C -> base case
pop C -> back to A
pop A

The stack order mirrors the recursion path.

Each “push” = recursive call; each “pop” = returning to parent.

5️⃣ Takeaways for Problem Solving

If a problem implies sequential decomposition with backtracking → think recursion.

If recursion depth is too large → convert to iterative stack to avoid call stack overflow.

Recursion + linked structures often simplifies reasoning about invariants and traversal order.
