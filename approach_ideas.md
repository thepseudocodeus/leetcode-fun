# PROBLEM SOLVING TECHNIQUES

## TECHNIQUE 1: INVARIANT-DRIVEN APPROACH

1. Find the fundamental invariant.
2. Establish the information-theoretic lower bound.
3. Create an algorithm that meets this bound and whose structure transparently reflects the invariant.

## TECHNIQUE 2: JIM SIMONS, ROBERT MERCER & RENAISSANCE TECHNOLOGIES

1. Define the pre-conditions
2. Define the post-conditions
3. Define the invariants
4. Construct a solution that satisfies all three
5. Verify the solution
