Social interaction and simulation
Realistic simulations: Agents can model human-like social behaviors, such as forming relationships and sharing information.

Emergent behavior: Complex social interactions can arise organically from the interactions of individual agents.

Challenges with using AI agents
While AI agents offer many benefits, there are also some challenges associated with their use:

Tasks requiring deep empathy / emotional intelligence or requiring complex human interaction and social dynamics – AI agents can struggle with nuanced human emotions. Tasks like therapy, social work, or conflict resolution require a level of emotional understanding and empathy that AI currently lacks. They may falter in complex social situations that require understanding unspoken cues.

Situations with high ethical stakes – AI agents can make decisions based on data, but they lack the moral compass and judgment needed for ethically complex situations. This includes areas like law enforcement, healthcare (diagnosis and treatment), and judicial decision-making.

Domains with unpredictable physical environments – AI agents can struggle in highly dynamic and unpredictable physical environments where real-time adaptation and complex motor skills are essential. This includes tasks like surgery, certain types of construction work, and disaster response.

Resource-intensive applications – Developing and deploying sophisticated AI agents can be computationally expensive and require significant resources, potentially making them unsuitable for smaller projects or organizations with limited budgets.

Use cases for AI agents
Organizations have been deploying agents to address a variety use cases, which we group into six key broader categories:

Customer agents

Customer agents deliver personalized customer experiences by understanding customer needs, answering questions, resolving customer issues, or recommending the right products and services. They work seamlessly across multiple channels including the web, mobile, or point of sale, and can be integrated into product experiences with voice or video.

Employee agents

Employee agents boost productivity by streamlining processes, managing repetitive tasks, answering employee questions, as well as editing and translating critical content and communications.

Creative agents

Creative agents supercharge the design and creative process by generating content, images, and ideas, assisting with design, writing, personalization, and campaigns.

Data agents

Data agents are built for complex data analysis. They have the potential to find and act on meaningful insights from data, all while ensuring the factual integrity of their results.

Code agents

Code agents accelerate software development with AI-enabled code generation and coding assistance, and to ramp up on new languages and code bases. Many organizations are seeing significant gains in productivity, leading to faster deployment and cleaner, clearer code.

Security agents

Security agents strengthen security posture by mitigating attacks or increasing the speed of investigations. They can oversee security across various surfaces and stages of the security life cycle: prevention, detection, and response.

Google Cloud and AI agents
Google Cloud provides a portfolio of products and solutions in the AI agent space. These include integrated AI assistants, pre-built AI agents, AI applications, and a platform of agent and developer tools to build custom AI agents.
